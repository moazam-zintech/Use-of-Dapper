ORM
Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a way to align programming code with database structures.
ORM uses metadata(The data which contian information about the data) descriptors to create a layer between the programming language and a relational database.
Dapper is an objectâ€“relational mapping product for the Microsoft .NET platform. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a traditional relational database.
